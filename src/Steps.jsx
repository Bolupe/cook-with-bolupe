  "Cook the Pasta: Boil spaghetti in a pot of salted water until it's al dente,which means it's cooked but still slightly firm to the bite. Follow the instructions on the pasta package for cooking time.",
  "Prepare the Sauce: While the pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a pan, add minced garlic and diced onions, and sauté them until they become fragrant and translucent. Then, add your choice of vegetables (like bell peppers, tomatoes, or mushrooms) and stir-fry them until they are tender.",
  "Combine and Season: Drain the cooked spaghetti and add it to the pan with the sautéed vegetables. Toss everything together and season with salt, pepper, and your favorite sauce (such as marinara, Alfredo, or pesto). Mix well until the pasta is coated with the sauce. Serve hot, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese or fresh herbs if desired.",
